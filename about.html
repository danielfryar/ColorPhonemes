    <p><h1>Color Phonemes</h1> is created by Daniel Fryar. It is meant for writers to more easily see the sounds in written words.</p>
    <p>This project was inspired by Roy Williams' Monday Morning Memos. To learn more about phonemes, read the following articles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/word-parts-and-the-music-of-vowels/">Word Parts and the Music of Vowels</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/newsletters/anything-too-stupid/">Anything Too Stupid</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/living-in-the-nick-of-time/">Living in the Nick of Time</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tool was built as a gift to the <a href="https://wizardofads.org/partners/">Wizard of Ads Partners</a>.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to the assemblers of the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary</a>. That project has enabled this one.</p>
    <p>If you find this tool fun or useful, I would be delighted to hear from you. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:danielfryar@wizardofads.com">danielfryar@wizardofads.com</a> with any thoughts, feedback, ideas, or bugs.</p>
