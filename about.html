    Color Phonemes is created by Daniel Fryar. It is meant for writers to more easily see the sounds in written words.
    This project was inspired by Roy Williams' Monday Morning Memos. To learn more about phonemes, read the following articles:
    <a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/word-parts-and-the-music-of-vowels/">Word Parts and the Music of Vowels</a>
    <a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/newsletters/anything-too-stupid/">Anything Too Stupid</a>
    <a href="https://www.mondaymorningmemo.com/living-in-the-nick-of-time/">Living in the Nick of Time</a>
    This tool was built as a gift to the <a href="https://wizardofads.org/partners/">Wizard of Ads Partners</a>.
    I am grateful to the assemblers of the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary</a>. That project has enabled this one.
    If you find this tool fun or useful, I would be delighted to hear from you. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:danielfryar@wizardofads.com">danielfryar@wizardofads.com</a> with any thoughts, feedback, ideas, or bugs.
    Thank you for visiting!
